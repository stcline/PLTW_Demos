### Scenario: Lifting a 50 kg Stone with a Crowbar

#### Lever Setup

- **Fulcrum**: Positioned 0.5 meters from the stone.
- **Effort Arm**: 1.5 meters from the fulcrum to where force is applied.
- **Load Arm**: 0.5 meters from the fulcrum to the stone.

#### Calculating the Required Effort

The weight of a 50 kg stone in Newtons is:

$$
\text{Weight} = 50 \ \text{kg} \times 9.81 \ \text{m/s}^2 = 490.5 \ \text{N}
$$

The mechanical advantage (MA) remains the same as before:

$$
\text{MA} = \frac{\text{Length of Effort Arm}}{\text{Length of Load Arm}} = \frac{1.5 \ \text{m}}{0.5 \ \text{m}} = 3
$$

The effort required to lift the stone is calculated as:

$$
\text{Effort} = \frac{\text{Weight}}{\text{MA}} = \frac{490.5 \ \text{N}}{3} \approx 163.5 \ \text{N}
$$

#### Practical Application

By applying a force of approximately 163.5 N at the end of the crowbar, you can lift the 50 kg stone. This demonstrates how a first-class lever can be effectively used to reduce the effort needed to move a heavy object.
